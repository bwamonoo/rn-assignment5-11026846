# Expo App README

## Description

This Expo app is a React Native application that showcases a simple home screen and settings screen, with support for dark mode. The app leverages the `react-native-vector-icons` library for icons, and uses context to manage the dark mode state across the app. It consists of the following main components:

1. **Home Screen**: Displays a welcome message, profile image, search icon, action icons (Send, Receive, Loan, Topup), and recent transactions.
2. **Settings Screen**: Provides navigation options to different settings pages (Language, Profile, Contact Us, Change Password, Privacy Policy) and a toggle switch for enabling/disabling dark mode.
3. **Dark Mode Feature**: Manages the dark mode state using a context provider, allowing other components to toggle and read the dark mode state.

## Features

- **Dark Mode**: Easily switch between light and dark themes using a toggle switch.
- **Navigation**: Navigate between different screens using React Navigation.
- **Custom Icons**: Utilize Ionicons for icons.
- **Reusable Components**: Modular components for actions and transactions for easy maintenance and reuse.
